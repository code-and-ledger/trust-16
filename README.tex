\subsection{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}}

Trust16 is an innovative blockchain-based game that challenges players
to navigate the delicate balance between cooperation and competition.
Built on the Aptos network, Trust16 combines elements of game theory,
social interaction, and cryptographic security to create a unique gaming
experience. Players engage in strategic matches, making decisions to
cooperate or compete, with outcomes determining reward distribution. The
game features 16 distinct character traits, a sophisticated prediction
system, seasonal play, and an AI bot mode, offering a rich, multifaceted
gaming experience that goes beyond mere entertainment to serve as a tool
for research and social good.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In an era where trust is increasingly valuable yet scarce, Trust16
emerges as a social experiment disguised as a game. It explores human
nature, decision-making processes, and the dynamics of trust in a
controlled, blockchain-powered environment. By incentivizing both
cooperation and competition, Trust16 creates a complex ecosystem where
strategy, psychology, and game theory intersect.

The name ``Trust16'' encapsulates the core concept of the game - trust -
and the 16 unique character traits that players can embody. This duality
represents the game's focus on both individual strategy and the broader
dynamics of group interaction.

\hypertarget{game-mechanics}{%

Trust16 implements a trait stability system to reflect player experience
and trait reliability:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Novice (10-24 games):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Initial trait unveiled
  \item
    Represented by a black and white trait icon
  \item
    Trait reassessed every 5 games
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Adept (25-99 games):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Trait gains partial coloration
  \item
    Reassessed every 10 games
  \item
    Increased accuracy in trait prediction
  \end{itemize}
\item

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Fully colored trait icon
  \item
    Trait reassessed every 25 games
  \item
    Highest stability and prediction accuracy
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This system provides visual feedback on player progression and trait
reliability, encouraging long-term engagement while allowing for early
trait assignment.

\hypertarget{trait-prediction-system}{%
\subsection{Trait Prediction System}\label{trait-prediction-system}}

Trust16 employs a quantitative trait prediction system to analyze player
behavior and assign the most probable character trait. This system uses
a player's recent game history to calculate a trait score, allowing for
dynamic trait assignment and strategic depth.

\hypertarget{trait-behavior-encoding}{%
\subsubsection{Trait Behavior
Encoding}\label{trait-behavior-encoding}}

Each trait is encoded with three behavioral indicators: - IC (Initial
Cooperation): \{0, 1, -\} - RC (Response to Cooperation): \{0, 1, -\} -
RT (Response to Competition): \{0, 1, -\}

Where: - 0 represents competition - 1 represents cooperation - -
represents a variable or adaptive response

\hypertarget{trait-prediction-algorithm}{%
\subsubsection{Trait Prediction
Algorithm}\label{trait-prediction-algorithm}}

Variables: - n: number of moves in the analyzed sequence - M = \{m₁, m₂,
\ldots, mₙ\}: sequence of player moves, where mᵢ ∈ \{0, 1\} - T: set of
all traits - For each trait t ∈ T: IC(t), RC(t), RT(t) ∈ \{0, 1, -\}

Scoring Algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Initial Cooperation Score: S\_IC(t) = \{ 1, if IC(t) = m₁ or IC(t) = -
  0, otherwise \}
\item
  Move Matching Score: S\_M(t) = ∑ᵢ₌₂ⁿ f(mᵢ, mᵢ₋₁, t)

  Where f(mᵢ, mᵢ₋₁, t) = \{ 1, if (mᵢ₋₁ = 1 and (mᵢ = RC(t) or RC(t) =
  -)) or (mᵢ₋₁ = 0 and (mᵢ = RT(t) or RT(t) = -)) 0, otherwise \}
\item
  Total Score: S\_total(t) = (S\_IC(t) + S\_M(t)) / n
\item
  Trait Prediction: Predicted Trait = argmax\_t S\_total(t)
\item
  Confidence Score: C(t) = S\_total(t) * 100\%
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{trait-ranking-and-selection}{%
\subsubsection{Trait Ranking and
Selection}\label{trait-ranking-and-selection}}

Traits are ranked by their S\_total(t) values in descending order. The
top k traits (e.g., k = 3) are selected as the most probable traits for
the player.

Top\_k\_traits = \{t₁, t₂, \ldots, tₖ \textbar{} S\_total(tᵢ) ≥
S\_total(tⱼ) for all j \textgreater{} i\}

\hypertarget{example-application}{%
\subsubsection{7.4 Example Application}\label{example-application}}

Consider two players with the following 10-move sequences:

Player 1: 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 Player 2: 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 0

Applying the trait prediction algorithm:

Player 1: - Cooperation Rate: 90\% - Top 3 predicted traits: 1. Dog
(Score: 10/10, Confidence: 100\%) 2. Honeybee (Score: 9/10, Confidence:
90\%) 3. Bear (Score: 8/10, Confidence: 80\%)

Player 2: - Cooperation Rate: 80\% - Top 3 predicted traits: 1. Owl
(Score: 9/10, Confidence: 90\%) 2. Dolphin (Score: 8/10, Confidence:
80\%) 3. Wolf (Score: 8/10, Confidence: 80\%)

\hypertarget{system-limitations-and-future-improvements}{%
\subsubsection{System Limitations and Future
Improvements}\label{system-limitations-and-future-improvements}}

The current trait prediction system has several limitations: 1. It
assumes equal weight for all moves in the sequence. 2. It does not
account for the opponent's moves or game context. 3. It may struggle
with highly adaptive or complex strategies.

Future improvements may include: 1. Weighted scoring based on move
recency or game phase. 2. Incorporation of opponent moves and game
context in the analysis. 3. Machine learning algorithms for more
sophisticated pattern recognition. 4. Longer-term player history
analysis for more accurate trait prediction.
