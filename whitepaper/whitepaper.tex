\section{Introduction}

In an era where trust is increasingly valuable yet scarce, Trust16 emerges as a social experiment disguised as a game. It explores human nature, decision-making processes, and the dynamics of trust in a controlled, blockchain-powered environment. By incentivizing both cooperation and competition, Trust16 creates a complex ecosystem where strategy, psychology, and game theory intersect.

The name "Trust16" encapsulates the core concept of the game - trust - and the 16 unique character traits that players can embody. This duality represents the game's focus on both individual strategy and the broader dynamics of group interaction.

\section{Game Mechanics}

Trust16 offers three distinct game modes, each designed to cater to different player needs and time commitments:

\subsection{Campaign Mode}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Purpose: Tutorial and trait introduction
    \item Players compete against AI bots
    \item Gradually introduces game mechanics and strategies
    \item Features all 16 character traits for players to interact with
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Short Game Mode}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duration: 5 rounds
    \item Fast-paced PvP matches
    \item Players make quick decisions to cooperate or compete in each round
    \item High-stakes final round
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long Game Mode}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duration: Variable, based on player-set chat time
    \item In-depth PvP matches with strategic elements
    \item Includes a chat phase for negotiation and strategy discussion
    \item Single round with higher stakes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Short Game Mode Mechanics}
The Short Game Mode in Trust16 is designed to create a fast-paced, strategic experience that encapsulates the core dynamics of trust and betrayal. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

\subsubsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each player deposits 10 TRUST
    \item The rewards pool contributes 20 TRUST
    \item Total Game Pool starts at 40 TRUST
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Rounds}
The game consists of 5 rounds. In each round:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Players simultaneously choose to either Cooperate (Green) or Compete (Red)
    \item Choices are revealed, and TRUST is redistributed based on the decisions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{TRUST Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If both players Cooperate (Green-Green):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each player receives 2 TRUST (1/5 of their deposit) + 2 TRUST (1/10 from game rewards pool)
    \end{itemize}
    \item If one player Competes and the other Cooperates (Red-Green):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Competing player receives: Their previous balance + Cooperating player's previous balance + 2 TRUST (1/5 of Cooperating player's deposit)
        \item Cooperating player receives: 2 TRUST (1/10 from game rewards pool)
    \end{itemize}
    \item If both players Compete (Red-Red):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In rounds 1-4: Both players receive 0 TRUST, and the round's TRUST goes back to the Game Pool
        \item In the final round (Round 5): Both players receive 0 TRUST, and all TRUST in the game (40 TRUST) goes back to the main rewards pool
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Game Pool Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Game Pool starts at 40 TRUST
    \item It decreases as players accumulate TRUST through cooperation
    \item It can increase if both players compete in non-final rounds
    \item In the final round, if both players compete, the Game Pool resets to 40 TRUST and returns to the main rewards pool
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Final Outcomes}
At the end of the 5 rounds, several outcomes are possible:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One player may have more TRUST than the other
    \item Both players may have equal TRUST (not zero)
    \item Both players may end with zero TRUST (if both compete in the final round)
    \item Any remaining TRUST in the Game Pool stays there (unless both compete in the final round)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example Scenarios}
To illustrate the diverse outcomes possible in Trust16's Short Game Mode, we present four scenarios:

\subsubsection{Scenario 1: Dramatic Reversal (Player 1 < Player 2)}
Players: Alice vs. Bob

\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1 (Green-Green): Alice: 4, Bob: 4, Pool: 32
    \item Round 2 (Green-Green): Alice: 8, Bob: 8, Pool: 24
    \item Round 3 (Red-Green): Alice: 18, Bob: 2, Pool: 20
    \item Round 4 (Green-Green): Alice: 22, Bob: 6, Pool: 12
    \item Round 5 (Green-Red): Alice: 2, Bob: 30, Pool: 8
\end{itemize}

End results: Alice: 2, Bob: 30, Pool: 8

This scenario demonstrates how a final round betrayal can dramatically reverse fortunes.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2: Early Advantage (Player 1 < Player 2)}
Players: Charlie vs. Diana

\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1 (Green-Green): Charlie: 4, Diana: 4, Pool: 32
    \item Round 2 (Green-Red): Charlie: 2, Diana: 10, Pool: 28
    \item Round 3 (Green-Green): Charlie: 6, Diana: 14, Pool: 20
    \item Round 4 (Green-Green): Charlie: 10, Diana: 18, Pool: 12
    \item Round 5 (Green-Green): Charlie: 14, Diana: 22, Pool: 4
\end{itemize}

End results: Charlie: 14, Diana: 22, Pool: 4

This scenario shows how an early competitive move can set the tone for the entire game.

\subsubsection{Scenario 3: Balanced Outcome (Player 1 = Player 2 â‰  0)}
Players: Eve vs. Frank

\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1 (Green-Green): Eve: 4, Frank: 4, Pool: 32
    \item Round 2 (Red-Green): Eve: 10, Frank: 2, Pool: 28
    \item Round 3 (Green-Red): Eve: 2, Frank: 14, Pool: 24
    \item Round 4 (Green-Green): Eve: 6, Frank: 18, Pool: 16
    \item Round 5 (Green-Green): Eve: 10, Frank: 22, Pool: 8
\end{itemize}

End results: Eve: 10, Frank: 22, Pool: 8

This scenario illustrates how alternating competition and cooperation can lead to a more balanced outcome.

\subsubsection{Scenario 4: Mutual Distrust (Player 1 = Player 2 = 0)}
Players: Grace vs. Henry

\begin{itemize}
    \item Round 1 (Green-Green): Grace: 4, Henry: 4, Pool: 32
    \item Round 2 (Green-Green): Grace: 8, Henry: 8, Pool: 24
    \item Round 3 (Red-Green): Grace: 18, Henry: 2, Pool: 20
    \item Round 4 (Green-Red): Grace: 2, Henry: 22, Pool: 16
    \item Round 5 (Red-Red): Grace: 0, Henry: 0, Pool: 40
\end{itemize}

End results: Grace: 0, Henry: 0, Pool returns 40 to main rewards pool

This scenario showcases how mutual competition in the final round can negate all previous gains.

\subsection{Core Mechanics}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Setup: Players connect wallets and select bet amounts
    \item Matchmaking: Smart contract pairs players with similar preferences
    \item Decision Phase: Players choose to cooperate (green) or compete (red)
    \item Outcome: Rewards are distributed based on choices as described in the Short Game Mode Mechanics
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Trait System}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Character traits are assigned based on playstyle across all game modes
    \item Trait visibility and progression apply in all PvP modes
    \item Campaign mode introduces players to all traits through bot interactions
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Architecture}

\subsection{Blockchain Integration}
Trust16 leverages the Aptos blockchain for its smart contract functionality, ensuring transparent and immutable game outcomes.

\subsection{Smart Contract}
The core smart contract handles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player matching
    \item Bet escrow
    \item Outcome verification
    \item Reward distribution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cryptographic Fairness}
Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) or commitment schemes are employed to ensure fair play and prevent result manipulation.

\subsection{Frontend}
A user-friendly interface built with React and Web3 libraries provides seamless wallet integration and game interaction.

\section{Tokenomics and Game Economy}

Trust16 introduces a unique, community-focused tokenomics model that provides direct value to players while simultaneously enriching the game's reward ecosystem.

\subsection{Token Valuation and Purchase}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 TRUST = 0.05â‚¬ (or 1â‚¬ = 20 TRUST)
    \item Standard Purchase Example: For 10â‚¬, a total of 200 TRUST is minted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Community-Boosting Dual Allocation}
When a player purchases TRUST tokens, the minted amount is equally split between the player and the game's Rewards Pool:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player Allocation: The player receives half of the total minted TRUST tokens
    \item Community Rewards Pool: The other half of the minted TRUST tokens is added directly to the game's Rewards Pool
\end{itemize}

Example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A player purchases 10â‚¬ worth of TRUST
    \item Total minted: 200 TRUST (10â‚¬ * 20 TRUST/â‚¬)
    \item The player receives 100 TRUST in their wallet
    \item Simultaneously, 100 TRUST is added to the Rewards Pool
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits of the Dual Allocation Model}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Direct Player Value: Players receive a substantial amount of TRUST tokens for their purchase
    \item Immediate Community Impact: Every purchase instantly grows the game's reward ecosystem
    \item Enhanced Gameplay Experience: A continually growing Rewards Pool allows for more frequent and valuable events and tournaments
    \item Aligned Incentives: Players are encouraged to invest in the game, knowing it directly enhances the experience for everyone
    \item Transparent and Fair: Clear split between player benefit and community contribution
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Rewards Pool Utilization}
The Rewards Pool, boosted by this dual allocation system, is used to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fund larger prize pools for tournaments and special events
    \item Provide enhanced bonuses for consecutive cooperative plays
    \item Offer substantial rewards for the Content Creator Campaign
    \item Create periodic "jackpot" events with significant TRUST token prizes
    \item Support additional community-building and engagement initiatives
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Economic Balancing Measures}
To ensure long-term sustainability:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Regular Economic Audits: Continuous monitoring of token supply, distribution, and usage patterns
    \item Seasonal Resets: The Rewards Pool partially resets each season, ensuring regular circulation of tokens
    \item Dynamic Reward Scaling: Reward amounts may be dynamically adjusted based on the size of the Rewards Pool
    \item Community Governance: Future implementation of governance mechanisms allowing long-term players to participate in economic decisions
\end{enumerate}

\section{Character Traits System}

\subsection{Core Traits}
The game maintains 16 standard character traits:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Owl: Strategic planner with wisdom and insight
    \item Fox: Clever tactician, outsmarting opponents
    \item Serpent: Cunning manipulator of the game's twists
    \item Dog: Trustworthy ally, standing by teammates
    \item Raccoon: Opportunist, turning chaos into advantage
    \item Lion: Fearless challenger, facing obstacles head-on
    \item Chameleon: Adaptable player, blending with changing situations
    \item Dolphin: Empathetic guide, navigating emotional waters
    \item Cheetah: Quick decision-maker, seizing instant opportunities
    \item Bear: Resilient endurer, standing firm against adversity
    \item Wolf: Team player, thriving in cooperative environments
    \item Peacock: Charismatic negotiator, excelling in social interactions
    \item Elephant: Methodical and memory-driven, learning from past experiences
    \item Honeybee: Industrious and community-oriented, contributing to the game's ecosystem
    \item Raven: Intelligent problem-solver, finding creative solutions
    \item Tiger: Bold risk-taker, not afraid to make daring moves
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Seasonal Trait Variations}
To keep the game dynamic and encourage strategic adaptation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each season, 4-6 characters receive significant trait changes or "seasonal variants"
    \item Seasonal variants feature visual changes (themed skins) and adjusted trait behaviors
    \item Remaining characters receive minor trait tweaks to keep the meta fresh
    \item Occasional introduction of new characters (yearly) with potential retirement of underperforming ones
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trait Impact}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Traits are visible to opponents before and during matches
  \item They provide insight into a player's likely strategy and behavior
  \item Traits influence matchmaking to create diverse and interesting game dynamics
  \item Seasonal variations encourage players to adapt strategies and explore new playstyles
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trait Stability and Progression}
Trust16 implements a trait stability system to reflect player experience and trait reliability:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Novice (10-24 games):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Initial trait unveiled
      \item Represented by a black and white trait icon
      \item Trait reassessed every 5 games
  \end{itemize}
  \item Adept (25-99 games):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Trait gains partial coloration
      \item Reassessed every 10 games
      \item Increased accuracy in trait prediction
  \end{itemize}
  \item Master (100+ games):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Fully colored trait icon
      \item Trait reassessed every 25 games
      \item Highest stability and prediction accuracy
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reputation System}

Trust16 implements a sophisticated Reputation System, represented by a soulbound token, which reflects a player's standing within the community.

\subsection{Reputation Basics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reputation is represented by a non-transferable (soulbound) token
  \item Reputation score ranges from 0 to 100 points
  \item Players start with 0 reputation upon joining Trust16
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reputation Formula}
The reputation score (R) is calculated using the following formula:

\begin{equation}
R = \min(100, GP + CB + SS + CE + CP - RD)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item GP: Games Played (max 50 points)
  \item CB: Cooperative Behavior (max 20 points)
  \item SS: Successful Strategies (max 15 points)
  \item CE: Community Engagement (max 10 points)
  \item CP: Consistent Play (max 5 points)
  \item RD: Reputation Decay
\end{itemize}

Each component is calculated as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Games Played (GP):
  \begin{equation}
  GP = \min(50, 0.5 * SG + LG)
  \end{equation}
  Where SG is the number of Short Games and LG is the number of Long Games played.

  \item Cooperative Behavior (CB):
  \begin{equation}
  CB = \min(20, 0.1 * GC + 0.05 * CGC)
  \end{equation}
  Where GC is the number of 'Green' (Cooperative) choices and CGC is the number of Consecutive 'Green' choices.

  \item Successful Strategies (SS):
  \begin{equation}
  SS = \min(15, 0.2 * W)
  \end{equation}
  Where W is the number of games won.

  \item Community Engagement (CE):
  \begin{equation}
  CE = \min(10, E + V + C)
  \end{equation}
  Where E is points from events, V is points from voting, and C is points from content creation.

  \item Consistent Play (CP):
  \begin{equation}
  CP = \min(5, 0.5 * D)
  \end{equation}
  Where D is the number of days played in the last 30 days.

  \item Reputation Decay (RD):
  \begin{equation}
  RD = \max(0, I - 30) * 0.5
  \end{equation}
  Where I is the number of inactive days.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Earning Reputation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Playing games (primary factor)
  \item Choosing cooperative actions
  \item Winning games
  \item Participating in community events and governance
  \item Creating and sharing content
  \item Maintaining consistent play
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reputation Decay}
