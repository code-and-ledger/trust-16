6. Reward Pool Protection:
   - Minimum threshold implemented
   - Bonuses reduced or suspended if threshold reached

7. Anti-Collusion Measures:
   - Algorithms detect suspicious patterns
   - Penalties for colluding accounts

### 5.6 Sample Game Calculation

For a 10-round game:
- Initial withdrawal: 110 $TRUST
- Platform fee: 5.5 $TRUST (or 3.3 $TRUST for $TRUST deposits)
- Playable amount: 104.5 $TRUST (or 106.7 $TRUST for $TRUST deposits)

Assuming 6 Green-Green, 3 Green-Red, 1 Red-Red outcomes:
- Green-Green: 6 * (22.99 $TRUST) = 137.94 $TRUST
- Green-Red: 3 * (20.9 $TRUST) = 62.7 $TRUST
- Red-Red: 1 * (20.9 $TRUST to pool) = 20.9 $TRUST

Total player payout: 200.64 $TRUST
Net to reward pool: 20.9 - 12.54 (bonuses) = 8.36 $TRUST

### 6.4 Trait Stability and Progression

Trust16 implements a trait stability system to reflect player experience and trait reliability:

1. Novice (10-24 games): 
   - Initial trait unveiled
   - Represented by a black and white trait icon
   - Trait reassessed every 5 games

2. Adept (25-99 games):
   - Trait gains partial coloration
   - Reassessed every 10 games
   - Increased accuracy in trait prediction

3. Master (100+ games):
   - Fully colored trait icon
   - Trait reassessed every 25 games
   - Highest stability and prediction accuracy

This system provides visual feedback on player progression and trait reliability, encouraging long-term engagement while allowing for early trait assignment.

## 7. Trait Prediction System

Trust16 employs a quantitative trait prediction system to analyze player behavior and assign the most probable character trait. This system uses a player's recent game history to calculate a trait score, allowing for dynamic trait assignment and strategic depth.

### 7.1 Trait Behavior Encoding

Each trait is encoded with three behavioral indicators:
- IC (Initial Cooperation): {0, 1, -}
- RC (Response to Cooperation): {0, 1, -}
- RT (Response to Competition): {0, 1, -}

Where:
- 0 represents competition
- 1 represents cooperation
- - represents a variable or adaptive response

### 7.2 Trait Prediction Algorithm

Variables:
- n: number of moves in the analyzed sequence
- M = {m₁, m₂, ..., mₙ}: sequence of player moves, where mᵢ ∈ {0, 1}
- T: set of all traits
- For each trait t ∈ T: IC(t), RC(t), RT(t) ∈ {0, 1, -}

Scoring Algorithm:

1. Initial Cooperation Score:
   S_IC(t) = {
     1, if IC(t) = m₁ or IC(t) = -
     0, otherwise
   }

2. Move Matching Score:
   S_M(t) = ∑ᵢ₌₂ⁿ f(mᵢ, mᵢ₋₁, t)
   
   Where f(mᵢ, mᵢ₋₁, t) = {
     1, if (mᵢ₋₁ = 1 and (mᵢ = RC(t) or RC(t) = -)) or
        (mᵢ₋₁ = 0 and (mᵢ = RT(t) or RT(t) = -))
     0, otherwise
   }

3. Total Score:
   S_total(t) = (S_IC(t) + S_M(t)) / n

4. Trait Prediction:
   Predicted Trait = argmax_t S_total(t)

5. Confidence Score:
   C(t) = S_total(t) * 100%

### 7.3 Trait Ranking and Selection

Traits are ranked by their S_total(t) values in descending order. The top k traits (e.g., k = 3) are selected as the most probable traits for the player.

Top_k_traits = {t₁, t₂, ..., tₖ | S_total(tᵢ) ≥ S_total(tⱼ) for all j > i}

### 7.4 Example Application

Consider two players with the following 10-move sequences:

Player 1: 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
Player 2: 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0

Applying the trait prediction algorithm:

Player 1:
- Cooperation Rate: 90%
- Top 3 predicted traits:
  1. Dog (Score: 10/10, Confidence: 100%)
  2. Honeybee (Score: 9/10, Confidence: 90%)
  3. Bear (Score: 8/10, Confidence: 80%)

Player 2:
- Cooperation Rate: 80%
- Top 3 predicted traits:
  1. Owl (Score: 9/10, Confidence: 90%)
  2. Dolphin (Score: 8/10, Confidence: 80%)
  3. Wolf (Score: 8/10, Confidence: 80%)

### 7.5 System Limitations and Future Improvements

The current trait prediction system has several limitations:
1. It assumes equal weight for all moves in the sequence.
2. It does not account for the opponent's moves or game context.
3. It may struggle with highly adaptive or complex strategies.

Future improvements may include:
1. Weighted scoring based on move recency or game phase.
2. Incorporation of opponent moves and game context in the analysis.
3. Machine learning algorithms for more sophisticated pattern recognition.
4. Longer-term player history analysis for more accurate trait prediction.
